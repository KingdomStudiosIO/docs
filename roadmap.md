# Roadmap

DeFi Kingdoms will continue to grow with new features, systems, maps, and cross-chain gameplay!&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This roadmap lists many, but not all feature releases currently planned. While they are generally in the order in which we expect them to be released, some items may shift and be released earlier or later, and others will be subdivided into additional parts.

The list below is meant as reference for new and old users, and a new interactive roadmap is slated to be released in the near future.

* **Traveling System**: Heroes will now be able to travel with their Heroes and Pets between different regions on the map to visit lands and complete quests.
* **Achievements**: Earn and collect unique achievements with a variety of challenging tasks and show them off to other players!

## Long-Term Roadmap Features
