# Roadmap

DeFi Kingdoms will continue to grow with new features, systems, maps, and cross-chain gameplay!&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This roadmap lists many, but not all feature releases currently planned. While they are generally in the order in which we expect them to be released, some items may shift and be released earlier or later, and others will be subdivided into additional parts.
{% endhint %}

## Current Priorities

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Priority_List_October_2024.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Divine Essence:** Transcend (burn) your Heroes in exchange for Divine Essence and other rewards, which can be used to reroll Hero level-ups, restore equipment, and more. See the full presentation in our [Governance and Alpha Roundtable](https://www.youtube.com/live/1A1BEGx3g18?si=XXCAqegFYF9CVM07) from May 29th on YouTube.
* **Equipment Durability:** A major aspect of the Equipment system, items will begin to degrade through use, eventually becoming unusable unless repaired or restored.
* **Mysterious Bannerman Activity:** The city of Submersia will call upon your Pleged Heroes in a new and interactive way...
* **Tournaments**: A built-in tournament feature will allow players to brawl with their Heroes in bracket-style PVP tournaments and compete for lucrative prizes.

### Secondary Priorities

* **Additional Combat Classes**: We are actively adding additional Class Skills to combat, and all classes can be used now with their basic attacks.
* **Additional Hunts Reward System:** A way to incentivize the grinder, this reward system will be backdated to include all victorious Hunts from the Void Hunt: Mad Boar launch up until the system is introduced.
* **Pet Combat Bonuses:** Reveal your Pets' combat bonuses and use them in PvE & PvP combat.
* **Glory and Honor:** Battle opponents with Glory on the line! Stake your Honor on the outcome of Bouts against other Commanders! Those with the most Glory and/or Honor will be rewarded!
* **PVP Experience Enhancements:** We are always working on improvements to both combat itself and the surrounding systems. Upgrades and updates will be coming!

## Long-Term Roadmap Features

* **Level 10 Mining Quests**: The final Profession Quests, Gold Mining and Token Mining, will get their more challenging Level 10 variants.
* **Yellow Egg Hatching (Mining Pets)**: Explore many new mining-themed pets and equip them to your Heroes to help them yield the best rewards while down in the mines.
* **Traveling System**: Heroes will now be able to travel with their Heroes and Pets between different regions on the map to visit lands and complete quests.
* **In-Game Chat**: Communicate with other players around the world with our in-game chat feature: -recruit guild members, trade Heroes, challenge players and more.
* **Achievements**: Earn and collect unique achievements with a variety of challenging tasks and show them off to other players!
* **Crafting**: Use your Heroes to harvest and craft various items and equipment!
* **Golden Egg Hatching**: The fifth and final egg type will be available for hatching new Pets.
* **Land Functionality**: DeFi Kingdoms Lands will receive a full set of features, including the release of land in Crystalvale.
