# Roadmap

DeFi Kingdoms will continue to grow with new features, systems, maps, and cross-chain gameplay!&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This roadmap lists many, but not all feature releases currently planned. While they are generally in the order in which we expect them to be released, some items may shift and be released earlier or later, and others will be subdivided into additional parts.

The list below is meant as reference for new and old users, and a new interactive roadmap is slated to be released in the near future.
