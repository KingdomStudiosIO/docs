# Heroes

Heroes in DeFi Kingdoms are utility-based NFTs with a variety of uses.&#x20;

Heroes can be paired to [Summon](summoning.md) more Heroes, whose classes, [stats](stats.md), and [rarity](rarity.md) are partially determined by the two Heroes used to infuse the Summoning Crystal.&#x20;

Heroes can engage in [Profession Quests](../quests/professions/) to earn JEWEL and in-game resources, as well as increases to the relevant profession skill and experience toward the next Hero level. Once Heroes reach an experience threshold, they can [level up](leveling.md) at the Meditation Circle.

Eventually, Heroes will be able to participate in further [Quests](../quests/) to gain loot and experience, including PVE quests in which they battle enemies.

The [Tavern](../locations/tavern.md) hosts the NFT Agent, who can assist with buying and selling Heroes, as well as renting them out for use in the Summoning [Portal](../locations/portal.md).
