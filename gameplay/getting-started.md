# Getting Started

Much of the gameplay in DeFi Kingdoms is centered around [Heroes](../learn/gameplay/heroes/), the utility-based NFTs that can gather resources with [Professions](../learn/gameplay/professions/) and will eventually be able to participate in combat quests and even PVP. You can visit the [Tavern](../learn/gameplay/tavern.md) to buy Heroes and you can learn more about what makes each Hero unique in the [Heroes](../learn/gameplay/heroes/) section of this guide.

If you don't have enough CRYSTAL or JADE yet to purchase a Hero, that's ok, too! You can deposit what you do have through the [Jeweler](../learn/gameplay/jeweler.md) (DEX & game fee distribution) or in the Gardens (liquidity pooling) to begin earning more tokens. Of course, you'll need to visit the [Marketplace](../learn/gameplay/marketplace.md) to trade for JEWEL in the first place.

The possibilities for gameplay and earning in DeFi Kingdoms are many and varied, so don't hesitate to explore this guide further to learn more about the options available to you!
