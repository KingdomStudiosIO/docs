## Class Description

Ah, the Archer class.

A formidable choice for those who possess the ability to make swift decisions and strike with deadly precision.

Wary of close-quarters combat, Archers observe their enemies from afar with keen eyes and dexterous fingers, making split-second decisions to help their companions against man or beast. Having an Archer in a party can tilt the odds before the battle begins as they rain arrows on their foes.

Three familiar archetypes guide the class fantasy of the Archer, all of which keep the enemy at a safe distance. The **Flurry** path honors those who seek to deliver death through a thousand cuts, while the **Precision** path speaks to the patient Heroes who wait for the optimal moment to strike. And for those with piercing minds and more than a sprinkle of Luck on their side, the **Marksmanship** path offers unique rewards.

Skill and cunning are required to master the Archer class, whether you prefer to strike quickly or wait for the perfect opportunity.
