## Class Description

The trust of the people is earned, not granted, and no class bears this stark truth with greater resolve than the brave and honorable **Knight**. Dedicated to upholding justice and protecting the innocent, such valiant heroes are truly a sight to behold, for they are the shield of the people, trained in the art of combat to become the ultimate protectors.

While Knights share the battle prowess and discipline of their Warrior counterparts, what sets Knights apart is their perennial loyalty to a strict code of chivalry, often in servitude to a Lord or individual holding great power. Knights never abandon their calling to aid, even if they face overwhelming odds.

For a Knight, a skill forged in relentless training is a power waiting to be wielded instinctively in battle. In turn, the Knight works tirelessly from squirehood to become a master of close quarters combat. Expertly trained in the art of standing in the way of big, scary things, the Knight is always the first across the line. Clad head-to-toe in sturdy armor and complete with a mighty appetite for the fray, the Knight deflects the attacks of their foes and protects those for whom they care.

But the Knight is not just a skilled fighter--nay, they are also driven by a strong sense of honor and duty, which guides their every action. Their abilities reflect this loyalty, focusing on reducing damage taken, redirecting attacks away from the weak, and granting protection to their trusted party. On the offensive, Knights strike hard to debilitate their foes, stunning or silencing them to give their team an advantage in battle or simply room to breathe.

Three paths lead a squire to Knighthood: the path of **Honor**, which emphasizes defense and protecting allies; the path of **Valor**, which focuses on strength and vigilance; and the path of **Iron**, which emphasizes debuffing and disrupting the enemy.

On the battlefield, the Knight is a formidable force, inspiring their allies to fight alongside them with courage and determination. Respected and admired by all who know them, their name is synonymous with honor and duty, none more so than Sir Robby Footly, the Knightliest of Knights.
