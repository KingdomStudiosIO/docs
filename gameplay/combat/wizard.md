## Class Description

**Wizards** are the masters of arcane knowledge and wielders of great power. They are the keepers of the lost secrets of the universe and can channel the very building blocks of our reality to do their bidding. Their mastery of the elements, their profound understanding of the hidden forces that underlie existence, and their unparalleled ability to manipulate flame, frost, and the mind, place them amongst the most feared and respected magical beings in the land.

The Wizard is a mysterious and enigmatic figure, often cloaked in flowing robes and wielding a staff or wand. Their knowledge of the arcane is seemingly endless, and their understanding of the world around them borders on the supernatural. They are not mere practitioners of magic, but the unlockers of mind-penetrating techniques, unearthed by delving deep into the secrets of the universe to uncover the true nature of reality itself, even if it isn’t pretty.

Wizards must use their abilities carefully, for the forces they wield are not easily controlled. The slightest misstep can lead to catastrophic consequences, and their power can just as easily consume them as it can their enemies. Only those with the discipline, knowledge, and wisdom to use their powers wisely can hope to become true masters of the arcane.

As they progress in their studies, the Wizard is presented with a choice—to follow one of three disciplines, each of which focuses on a specific aspect of the arcane arts, or master it all in hopes of weaving these dangerous techniques into one. The Pyromancer, the Cryomancer, and the Arcanist all represent unique approaches to the study of magic, and each offers a distinct set of abilities and strengths.

**Pyromancy**, the art of manipulating fire, is one of the most well-known and feared of the Wizard’s disciplines. The Pyromancer’s spells are focused on dealing massive amounts of damage and setting their foes ablaze. With a single word and a flick of their wrist, a Pyromancer can unleash a deluge of fire and ash that engulfs everything in its path, leaving nothing but smolder in its wake. As a master of flame and destruction, the Pyromancer harnesses the raw power of fire to incinerate their enemies and add insult to injury.

The **Cryomancer**, on the other hand, is a master of ice and control. A Cryomancer can freeze enemies in their tracks, immobilizing them with the icy grip of winter, or launch razor-sharp shards of ice that slice through armor and flesh alike. Their spells are focused on dealing damage and applying Chill, which slows their enemies and reduces their effectiveness in combat.

The **Arcanists**, however, are the most enigmatic of the Wizards. They wield a power that is beyond comprehension, tapping into the deepest mysteries of the universe to attack the mind and project magical energy fields. They can erect protective barriers, cloak themselves in impenetrable force fields, or reach into the minds of their enemies, shattering their wills and leaving them powerless to resist an incoming attack. Those Arcanists who are truly gifted may someday unlock the truth that all elemental magic is based in the arcane. Those who do learn this truth effortlessly blend arcane power and the elements around them to enact their agenda… and their vengeance.

As a result, each Wizard’s mastery of their chosen discipline is further enhanced by their ability to manipulate arcane power. The more they channel this power, the more they can unleash its destructive force, tearing through enemies with ease and reshaping the elements around them to gain advantage. This power is made stronger when combined with their ability to weave their spells and unlock even greater abilities.

Wizards are the masters of arcane knowledge and wielders of great power, and their abilities are as diverse as the elements themselves. They are the keepers of the secrets of the universe and can channel the very fabric of reality to do their bidding.
