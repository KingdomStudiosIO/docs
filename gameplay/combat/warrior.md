## Class Description

The thrill of battle, the glory of a hard fought victory, and the oceans of blood and sweat that come along with it; the **Warrior** lives for the battlefield. Some say Warriors are the fiercest fighters in the realm, others say the gods adorned them with unrivaled strength and endurance, but pretty much everyone agrees that you should never mess with one unless you have to.

A durable and powerful melee class, the Warrior excels in close-quarters combat and can adapt to different situations with a wide array of skills and abilities. They are the backbone of any adventuring party, and are often called upon to lead the charge into battle - even as mercenaries. They truly are the embodiment of strength and courage, a true force to be reckoned with.

Whether it be in the heat of combat or in a quiet moment of contemplation, the three paths of the Warrior each require the need for constant growth and improvement. Each with its own identity and approach to handling the chaos of the fray. Each with its own way to start and quickly end a fight.

First, the path of the **Gladiator** is for those Warriors who have honed their skills in the subtle art of cleaving things in two. The Gladiator leverages their considerable strength to overwhelm and crush their enemies with heavy physical blows. This path focuses on both aggressive and powerful single target attacks and whirlwind spins hastily executed to cut through enemy teams, leaving nothing but destruction and mayhem in their wake.

Second, the **Juggernaut** is a Warrior of few words and even fewer… thoughts. Fully-equipped with an ever-present look of "come at me", the endurance and raw defense of a Juggernaut allows them to shrug off the most powerful of blows and even become unstoppable in the face of a formidable opponent. Unbridled instinct and utter defiance take over to mitigate physical attacks and to resist any incoming onslaught with ease, making the Juggernaut a wall of defense for their allies that can also stop enemies dead in their tracks.

Lastly, the **Bloodthirst** path lends the Warrior significant sustained damage in the face of a tiring enemy. Pure rage and frenzied fury adds fuel to the fires of battle, rewarding these Warriors for their excellent bladework and hardened bloodlust. Intimidation, strength, and a touch of madness are enough to execute any weakened foe, but are never enough to stay the hand of this battle-obsessed and hard-nosed Warrior. Look to the bloodthirsty to never relent once the battle has begun, but most certainly expect the Warrior to strike the final blow to end it.

Beware, for the Warrior's path is not an easy one. It requires unwavering determination and courage even when facing off against the most deadly of foes. But for those who are willing to take upon themselves these challenges head-on, the rewards are great.
