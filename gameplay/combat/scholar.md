## Class Description

In a world where swords clash and spells sear the skies, where dungeons hide treasures and forests house mythical creatures, the **Scholar** finds its power in the unyielding realms of the mind. Scholars are not just humble book-keepers or simple scroll-readers. Nay, they are sagacious adventurers, ever vigilant in their quest for enlightenment — and truth.

As Wizards harness the elements, Warriors wield weapons of steel, and Archers let loose death from above, the Scholar holds the realm of the mind as its domain. As keepers of ancient knowledge, unriddlers of arcane mysteries, and weavers of scholarly magic both subtle and profound, the Scholar’s gifts come in the form of truths, and those truths can be deadly.&#x20;

With a whispered phrase or a calculated theorem, the Scholar is capable of not only manipulating arcane energies but also weaving spells of persuasion, or deciphering codes that have baffled lesser minds for centuries through steady and stoic study: **Observation**, **Investigation**, and **Experimentation**. These are not just pathways to mastery; they are the quintessence of the Scientific Method.

The first of these sacred avenues is **Observation**. Scholars who walk this path embody the primal step of any scientific endeavor: to observe the world in unerring detail. Yet Observation isn’t mere idle watching; it is an active, tactile skill. These are the keen minds who gaze upon a battlefield and discern the invisible patterns of enemy formations or scrutinize the gentle eddies in a spellcaster’s aura to foretell which incantation will be invoked next. They see the hidden runes in ancient architecture, the infinitesimal twitch that betrays a liar, and the telltale signs of a trap-laden corridor. To an Observation Scholar, the rules of nature and magic exist for a reason. It is their solemn duty to understand those rules deeply and effect change within their confines. When an Observation Scholar raises their quill, it’s not merely to document but to set the stage for transformation, all within the bounds of cosmic law.

Second, there stands the path of **Investigation**. While Observers are the gatherers of data, Investigators are its interpreters, the ones who ask the perilous ‘why’ and ‘how.’ Investigators will ask questions, even when conventional wisdom or taboos suggest they shouldn’t. Every page turned, every inquiry made, is a stride closer to decoding the world’s most labyrinthine enigmas. Yet caution is their constant companion. A Scholar who asks too many questions may unsettle powers that are best left undisturbed. After all, to look behind certain veils may be to never see the world the same way again. The allure of the forbidden is strong, but every Investigation Scholar must ask: Is it worth it?

For those who say “yes”, there is but only one discipline. The tempestuous discipline of **Experimentation** beckons those Scholars insatiable in their quest for truth. They are the avant-garde architects of intellectual landscapes, unafraid to challenge established facts and paradigms. Building upon the sturdy foundations laid by Observation and Investigation, they push the boundaries of knowledge into uncharted terrains — often heedless of the risks involved. It’s not enough for these Scholars to understand the natural order; they aim to stretch, subvert, and redefine it. Consequences be damned; if a veil exists, they shall pierce it, if a stone lies unturned, they shall flip it. For them, the thrill of intellectual achievement often transcends prudence and caution. The allure of forbidden or hidden truths is almost irresistible, and many are those who have paid the price for such reckless thirst. Yet, without these brave — or perhaps foolhardy — souls, the realm of knowledge would be a stagnant pool rather than a raging river.

Though each discipline embodies a unique part of the Scientific Method and unique viewpoint on how science, knowledge, and magic collide, a true Scholar often finds a synergetic dance amongst them all. The Observation discipline feeds into Investigation, honing questions into sharpened theories. Investigation, in turn, inspires new routes for Experimentation, pushing the boundaries of what is known. And Experimentation loops back, creating new phenomena for Observation, enriching the never-ending cycle of inquiry and discovery.

Navigating this labyrinthine path of the intellect is no simple task. It is a journey whose daily companions are cerebral challenges, mental melees, and snares of sophistry. Those who step onto this path must know that intellect is both sword and shield in the Scholar’s arsenal, and it cuts both ways.
