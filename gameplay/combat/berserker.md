## Class Description

Unbridled, unrelenting chaos. The **Berserker** wastes no time to claim what is rightfully theirs: everything. Simply put, the Berserker is a champion of chaos, a herald of destruction, and a brutal warrior who embraces the madness deep within. A Berserker as a party member is a thing of beauty as they effortlessly summon forth overwhelming strength to enact pain on any foe, but also upon any friend. In turn, it's easy to mistake the Berserker for a natural catastrophe as they are nearly indistinguishable from a tempest of fury or a storm that tears across the battlefield, leaving naught but devastation in their wake. The very earth quakes beneath their feet.

The power of the Berserker lies in their ability to unleash their rage upon the battlefield, decimating all who dare to stand in their way. They draw forth their primal instincts, tapping into their innermost fury and channeling it through their weaponry. The Berserker is a living weapon, each strike imbued with a deadly ferocity unmatched by any other. But beware, for the untamed rage of the Berserker is not easily contained. They may unleash hell upon their foes, but they also risk losing control of themselves, succumbing to a blood raged craze. In turn, the Berserker is a hero for the bold, a weapon for the daring, and a reminder that in the heat of battle, anything can happen.

Three skill paths are available for the Berserker to tread, each one embracing a different aspect of their inner madness.

The first is the path of the **Bear**, which harkens back to the timeless legend of Bödvar Bjarki, the fabled bear skin clad warrior known for his unbreakable spirit and immense power. Like Bödvar, Berserkers who follow the Bear path embody raw strength and resilience, shrugging off blows that would fell lesser warriors and even growing stronger with each injury they sustain. They are the embodiment of what it means to be fierce and with each blow struck and each wound sustained, the Bear Berserker weaponizes their fury to amplify their strength and steady their feet. The second path of the Berserker is the Wolf, a cunning predator who embodies the fierce savagery of the beast.

The path of the **Wolf** is one of stealth and guile, striking with surprising speed and unleashing their wrath upon their unsuspecting foes. Their rage is fueled by the fear of their enemies, and with each terror-filled howl, they draw upon the strength of their ancestral spirit, the "Evening Wolf" Berserker known as the Kvelduf. As they channel the ferocity of the wolf, they grow stronger still, becoming a force of nature on the battlefield, leaving nothing but destruction in their wake.

The final path of the Berserker is the **Boar**, a whirlwind of senseless destruction. These warriors embody the raw, wild madness of the beast, their very being driven by the desire to cause chaos and mayhem. The Boar path of the Berserker is not for the faint of heart, for it embodies the true essence of the Jöfurr, the most feared warriors known to the lands of old. They were known to habitually partake in the consumption of Henbane mushroom, which further heightened their bloodlust and brought them to the brink of madness and from this madness, the Jöfurr derived great strength and power. The Boar path is for those who seek to harness that power of unbridled chaos and bring it to the battlefield.

No matter the path chosen, the Berserker will make its claim on the battlefield. Their rage is fueled by the thrill of the hunt, the rush of the kill, and the glory of the victory and their abilities reflect the chaos and destruction they bring to battle. They are capable of inflicting massive damage, reducing the power of their enemies, or even turning upon their own party in a blind rage. The Berserker is a weapon of war, a tool of destruction, and a terror to all who face them in battle.
