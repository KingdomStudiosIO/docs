## Class Description

On the perilous frontiers of Gaia, few can match the magical prowess of the **Summoner**. Through ancient rituals and arcane knowledge, these masters of conjuration call forth beings and energies of unimaginable power to fight by their side and protect allies. Whether summoning celestial entities, commanding dark energies, or forging bonds with the everpresent ethereal spirits of this plane, the Summoner's path is one of uncharted exploration, mystical study, and profound potential.

When it comes to harnessing trans-realm magicks, the Summoner is both the weaver and the loom. Their abilities draw from the very fabric of the universe, intertwining elements of creation, destruction, and spirit. A Summoner does not merely cast spells - they commune with otherworldly forces, binding them to their will either in partnership or in servitude. This delicate balance between control and chaos defines the Summoner, making them a singular and potent presence on the battlefield. They unlock the mysteries of summoning, shaping reality with a flick of their wrist and a whisper of borrowed power.

A Summoner's journey is shaped by three distinct disciplines, one academic, one practical, and one forbidden - each offering a different approach to harnessing their magical potential. These paths are the essence of their training, allowing them to specialize in summoning celestial, dark, or spirit entities.&#x20;

The **Summon** Aspect discipline accesses the power of the celestial and elemental realms, uniting planes to make summoning an extension of their will. Summoners attune to the raw energies of creation, calling forth entities from other realms to embrace our own. These summoned entities embody both purity and power, but also a situational partnership. Whether conjuring a celestial being to strike down foes with radiant light or summoning a clay golem to reshape the very battlefield under the feet of their foe, Summoners of this discipline wield the forces of the universe with precision and grace. Their connection to transient energies allows them to weaken their opponents defenses, restrict enemy movements, and deliver punishing wide area spell damage, making them potent offensive mages who can turn the tide of battle with a single invocation.

But where there is light, one can always find the dark. Embracing the shadows and the void, the **Dark Summoner** delves into the forbidden arts to command powers that others dare not approach. Dark Summoners are reminiscent of those Scholars who delved too deep and touched the void, the difference is that Dark Summoners kept delving. As masters of debilitation and control, Dark Summoners wield dark energy to bend the will of their enemies and sow chaos on the battlefield. An advanced Dark Summoner even has the potential to call forth demonic entities from the abyss to wreak havoc and instill terror, and they'd gladly do so even without complete control over their invited guest. This perspective on how magic could be used, rather than how it should be used, results in a path fraught with danger, for the void demands a price for its near-infinite power. Yet, those who can master this dark art find themselves capable of feats beyond the reach of mere mortals and they'll gladly pay that price, or find someone who will.

On the other end of the umbral spectrum are those Summoners who walk the path of the **Spirit Bond**. These Summoners forge deep, mystical connections with the spirits that inhabit the ethereal planes. These Summoners are not only conjurers but also healers and protectors, using their abilities to shield their allies and mend their wounds. Through the use of ritualistic summoning circles and umbral magic, they channel the essence of benevolent entities to provide both physical and magical fortitude to their companions. This discipline emphasizes the importance of preparation and strategy, as each summoning and spellcasting action is meticulously planned to maximize its benefit. If you see a Summoner drawing glyphs on the ground, you must decide whether to run to the safe haven they create or run far away to escape the pending destruction they will soon unleash.

As a Summoner, you transcend the traditional boundaries of magic and physical might. Your journey is one of perpetual discovery, where each summon and spell is a step towards ultimate enlightenment - whether for good or for… not so good. By harmonizing each force pulled or invited from the celestial, void, and spirit realms, you can unlock magic woven into magnitudes of power. Woven by your own hands.
