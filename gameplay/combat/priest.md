## Class Description

The **Priest**, a holy warrior anointed with the ancient and mystical power of the divine, is a powerful and versatile class of devoted spellcasters. Each warrior of light wields the magic of prayer, the holy light itself, and an array of gods-given blessings to heal and protect their allies, while channeling the authority of the heavens to smite and vanquish their foes.

The codex of the Priest may be easy to stumble upon, but it is not filled with mere trifling incantations. Deep within each holy grimoire dwells formidable blessings that call forth the celestial forces of the light to aid them in battle. While adept in magical weaponry, their faith in the divine is their greatest strength, and it empowers them to become an unrivaled support to their comrades in battle.

Reserved for the most devoted servants, three disciplines empower the Priest to become lossless conduits to channel their deities’ wishes: **Prayer**, **Holy**, and **Blessings**.

The **Prayer** path allows them to invoke the power of the divine to heal their allies, imbuing them with powerful wards that protect them from the foul magicks of fear and silence. They create auras of holy light that surround their allies, providing clarity and safety within the warmth of the Priest’s protection.&#x20;

The **Holy** path empowers the Priest to channel the gifts of the divine to heal their allies, and deal damage to their enemies. Channeling radiant energy from the gods is not small feat, but the Priest shapes the light to restore the vitality of their party members and with each application, gain access to greater power.&#x20;

Finally, the **Blessings** path allows the Priest to purify and bestow blessings to their allies, soothing the pains of war and granting gifts of legendary might. Each blessing is imbued with the power of the divine, granting their allies potent boons in battle that only a Priest can provide.&#x20;

Life is a sacred gift, and each party member risks it all to defeat their enemy. A Priest is a shining beacon of hope in the darkest of battles and their powers are a testament to the power of the divine. With a Priest in their ranks, the road to victory is that much more secure. Take heart, a Priest is never to be underestimated and a Priest always brings a cleanse.
