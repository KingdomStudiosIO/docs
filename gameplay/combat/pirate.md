## Class Description

Whether ye be a wily sea dog or a daring scallywag, it's nearly impossible to resist the call of the sea and the **Pirate** is a class of Heroes who just couldn't say no. A true Pirate savors a good game of chance and relishes in living on the edge of a fine blade, for better or for worse. Those who choose to embrace the life of a Pirate do so with a fearless spirit, a thirst for adventure, and an even bigger appetite for risking it all. Their mastery over the wind and waves is a testament to their boldness and their unwavering determination to chart their own course through life. Whether it be the roar of their firearms, the flash of their cutlasses, or the twists of fate, the Pirate is a force to be reckoned with.

The Pirate is a versatile and unpredictable class, able to adapt to any situation with ease. They are quick on their feet and nimble with their blades, making them formidable in hand-to-hand combat, but they're not-too-shy about waving a trusty blunderbuss around. They can call upon the power of the tides and the winds, using it to bolster their strength and lead their shipmates to victory. They can even conjure forth fearsome sea creatures to do their bidding. But the Pirate is not without their flaws. Their love of adventure and treasure can sometimes lead them down a dangerous path, causing them to take risks that humbler Heroes might avoid, and their three skill paths reflect that affinity for danger.

The **Busster** path focuses on dealing punishing ranged attacks with a fearsome blunderbuss pistol. No small amount of dexterity is required to master this path, which allows the Pirate to take out enemies from a distance with their bombastic dragon. Whether it's a strafing warning shot that puts an opponent in its place, a deafening wide blast that deals physical damage to multiple enemies, or an overwhelming barrier-busting explosion, the Pirate is no joke from behind a scope.

The second path is one that honors the ancient and always respected guidelines of **The Pirate Code**. This path reflects the defining elements of what it means to be a swashbuckling rogue that lives outside the inconvenient confines of the law. An unsheathed cutlass and a major measure of strength are required in such a hostile environment of up close and personal diplomatic discourse. An unlucky Jenkins could find themselves quickly on the backfoot from a swift slash that, unless properly treated, could be a matter of life or death. And if that's not enough to do the job, there's always a nice walk off the plank to meet one's maker in the murky depths below.

Lastly, the Pirate has its one true love, the sea itself. The **Luck of the Sea** path is about trusting in the heart of the ocean and relying on the mysteries that piracy has unearthed over generations of gamblers and ruffians. Wit, good fortune, and of course a giant kraken are always reliable resources to turn the tide of battle. But what boons the sea provides can also be ripped away. In turn, this path is by far the most perilous and fool-hardy of all paths, but it also conceals the greatest rewards for those with enough courage to embrace the dark depths and claim its bounty.

A unique blend of cunning and brute force, the Pirate honors the seafaring traditions of the rogue and the smuggler, while tapping into the unseen forces of the open waters and their innate affinity for those waves. This hero of the seas is a master of deception, cunning, and brash bravery and if they can calm their own wanderlust and adventurous spirit, they may just lead a crew to victory.
