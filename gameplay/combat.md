## Combat Keywords

**Keywords** have set meanings and impacts on Combat. They define various portions of actions that can be taken and the effects of **Abilities**. The Keyword itself is used as a shorthand to reference its definition.

## Genetic Traits

Heroes all have **Genetic Traits**, some of which are **Active** and some **Passive**, all of which are broken down into Basic, Advanced, Elite, and Exalted tiers.&#x20;

### **Active Traits**

A Heroâ€™s **Active Traits** can be activated once per Battle and use an Action. They have no Mana cost.

_Note: `POWER` is equal to the greater between the Hero's `ATTACK` or `SPELL`._
