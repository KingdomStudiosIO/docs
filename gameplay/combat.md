## Combat Keywords

**Keywords** have set meanings and impacts on Combat. They define various portions of actions that can be taken and the effects of **Abilities**. The Keyword itself is used as a shorthand to reference its definition.

## Genetic Traits

Heroes all have **Genetic Traits**, some of which are **Active** and some **Passive**, all of which are broken down into Basic, Advanced, Elite, and Exalted tiers.&#x20;
