# Vithraven's Reawakening

Vithraven’s Reawakening is a limited time event that allows owners of Gen0 heroes to "reroll" some of their Hero's genes. This is being done to ensure that the new basic genes introduced with the Crystalvale expansion have a similar rarity to the original 8 sets of genes. Existing Gen0 holders will be given an opportunity to reroll some of their genes, with the new Crystalvale genes being possible options. Players will have 31 days to take advantage of this opportunity in Serendale, and will be eligible to receive a series of rewards. Arch Druid Agranum at the Portal will guide you through the process.&#x20;

### **Gene Rerolling**

* Subclass dominant and recessive genes

**Appearance Genes**

* Hair style dominant and recessive genes
* Hair color dominant and recessive genes

### **Rewards**

Each of the three reroll options provide a number of rewards, with the greatest rewards coming from rerolling both Game and Appearance genes. Rewards include experience bonuses, stat bonuses, bonus items, an effective summon reset, and achievement rewards. The rewards as they relate to the three options available are detailed in the table below:

Rerolling your Gen0 Hero’s genes will help balance the gene pool and kickstart the appearance of new genes across Gaia.
