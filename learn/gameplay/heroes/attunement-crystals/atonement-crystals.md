# Atonement Crystals

Atonement Crystals are an item created to make players whole if and when bugs are found in the leveling process that impact Hero stat gains. Atonement Crystals are provided by airdrop to players who owned impacted Heroes the time that they were leveled, even if that Hero has since been sold or transferred.

Atonement Crystals are, functionally, a subset of [Attunement Crystals](./). Only one Atonement or Attunement Crystal may be used per leveling ritual.

Additionally, Heroes may only use each type of Atonement Crystal once.

Below is a summary of the Atonement Crystals that have been issued to date.
