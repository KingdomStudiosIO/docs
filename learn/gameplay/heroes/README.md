# Heroes

Heroes in DeFi Kingdoms are utility-based NFTs with a variety of uses.&#x20;

Heroes can be paired to [Summon](summoning.md) more Heroes, whose classes, [stats](stats.md), and [rarity](rarity.md) are partially determined by the two Heroes used to infuse the Summoning Crystal.&#x20;

Heroes can engage in [Professions Quests](../professions/) to earn JEWEL and in-game resources, as well as increases to the relevant profession skill and experience toward the next Hero level. Once Heroes reach an experience threshold, they can [level up](leveling.md) at the Portal.

Eventually, Heroes will be able to participate in further [Quests](quests.md) to gain loot and experience, including PVE quests in which they battle enemies.

The Tavern hosts the NFT Agent, who can assist with buying and selling Heroes, as well as renting them out for use in the Summoning [Portal](../portal.md).
