# Rarity

Each Hero has not only a class, subclass, and array of [stats](stats.md), but a rarity level as well. Every **Summon** has a chance to produce Heroes of each rarity level; however, [Summoning](../../../gameplay/heroes/summoning/) with more rare Heroes increases the likelihood that the Summoned Hero will be of a higher rarity. Rare Heroes are coveted because each level of rarity corresponds with bonuses to the base stat levels of your Hero.

## Rarity Indicators

The following symbols appear in the center of your Hero's card, indicating their rarity level.&#x20;

## Rarity and Summoning

The rarity of a Hero is influenced by the rarity of the Heroes used to infuse the Summoning Crystal.&#x20;

For full information on Summoning, visit the main [Summoning](../../../gameplay/heroes/summoning/) topic page.

## Shininess

In addition to rarity, every Hero has a small chance of being Shiny, which increases if the Summoning Heroes are also Shiny. Being Shiny makes heroes more popular among the ladies and gentlemen of the court, ensures they never step in dung, and makes their character card Shiny. It has no other use in the game and is purely aesthetic.
