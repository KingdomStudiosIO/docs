Profession Quests are one type of quest that Heroes can participate in, earning item rewards and experience points (XP). Each Hero has a Profession that they specialize in, which gives them more efficiency when engaging in that Quest. Quest rewards are determined by the Hero's Profession Skill, as well as the two stats that are associated with each Profession. Find more details on each individual Profession page.
