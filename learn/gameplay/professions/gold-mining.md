# Gold Mining

**Gold Mining Quests** can be performed by up to six Heroes at a time in each realm. These quests award **Gold**, and can award other rare items.

> _Oi! Want to work those wee arms ya got? Grab a pickaxe! There's plenty o' shinies awaiting eager hands ta take them home!_

Gold Mining Quests are begun in the **Professions** zone by speaking to the **Miner** or **Pickman**, depending on the realm. Any Hero can attempt Gold Mining Quests, but Heroes with the **Mining profession gene** will use their Stamina more efficiently and have increased chances of item rewards. Successfully completing a Gold Mining Quest will grant each Hero a small amount of XP, and a chance toward increasing their **Mining skill**.

These quests also have a chance to reward Heroes with **Gaia's Tears**, **Runes**, and **Yellow Pet Eggs**. All of these items may be swapped at the Trader in the [Marketplace](../marketplace.md) for other tokens or items. Some items are also used as reagents in **Potions** and [Enhancement Stones](../heroes/enhancement-stones.md), for hatching [Pets](../heroes/pets.md), and for [leveling Heroes](../heroes/leveling.md).

### **Mining Basics**

#### Duration per Stamina

12 minutes (10 with the **Mining profession gene**)

#### Stamina Required

1 Stamina minimum

#### Required Hero Range

1-6 Heroes

#### Minimum XP Reward

4 XP per Stamina spent + 8 XP per 5 Stamina spent

### **Gold Rewards**

The amount of **Gold** rewarded from **Gold Mining Quests** per Stamina spent is based on the Hero's **Strength** and **Endurance** stats, its **Mining skill,** and the presence of the **Mining profession gene**. Each Hero calculates Gold rewards independently, even when questing as a group.

### **Item Rewards**

{% hint style="info" %}
The item drop rates below are increased by varying combinations of the Hero's **Strength** and **Endurance** stats, its **Mining skill,** and the presence of the **Mining profession gene**.
