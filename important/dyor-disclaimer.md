# DYOR - Disclaimer

**DYOR \(Do Your Own Research\)** is a common thing to hear when discussing blockchain investments. Managing your risk is an important key when investing into decentralized finance. [Binance Academy said it well:](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/do-your-own-research)

_"DYOR aims to reduce the number of uninformed investors in cryptocurrency. It encourages them to research and understand a cryptocurrency before investing so that they can answer precisely why they are buying that currency and supporting that project._

_The term is also often used as a disclaimer when cryptocurrency traders and enthusiasts make public posts or share their market analyses on social media platforms."_
