# Phase 3 - Kingdoms & Land

During the third major phase, the fog of war on the world map will be rolled back to reveal mountains, oceans, deserts, dungeons, and kingdom plots available for purchase.

* Land Auction
* World Map expansion
* 25 Kingdom Plots will be given to random winners from people who had at least 5,000 xJEWEL tokens in their bank balance by Nov 13, 2021 _(For each additional 5000 xJEWEL a player has in the bank, they will get 2 extra entries in the drawing of random winners.)_
* 25 more Kingdom Plots will be given to random winners from people who had at least 1,000 xJEWEL tokens in their bank balance by Nov 13, 2021. Additional snapshots will be taken every 8 to 12 hours for 4 weeks, ending on Dec 11, 2021. Total number of entries will be determined by average amount of xJEWEL across all snapshots for all holders who qualified during the initial snapshot. _(For each additional 1,000 xJEWEL a player has in the bank, they will receive 2 extra entries.)_
