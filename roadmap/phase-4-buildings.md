# Phase 4 - Buildings

Buildings can be built within your kingdom and upgraded to increase their bonuses. Resource buildings can be built next to resource nodes to allow your kingdom to begin accumulating the resources you need to build more buildings and craft rare equipment for heroes.

Other buildings can provide passive bonuses to your heroes, improving their quest efficiency and stats. Still others can allow you to gain higher multipliers on your staking rewards in the gardens. Buildings are a fun and exciting way to increase your effectiveness in the game.
