# Realms

DeFi Kingdoms has always been envisioned as a **cross-chain game** with **multiple realms** that have their own unique flavors and different opportunities for players. Currently, there are two realms: **Serendale** and **Crystalvale**, with more planned in the future. Other blockchains will have **Outposts** allowing players to easily onboard and bridge tokens from the chain of their choice into one of our realms.

## Serendale 1.0 (Harmony)

DeFi Kingdoms: Serendale originally launched on the Harmony network on August 22, 2021 as a DEX with LP farming opportunities. Heroes and Quests came soon after. Serendale on Harmony officially closed on October 12, 2022, and was converted into an Outpost.

## Crystalvale (DFK Chain)

DeFi Kingdoms: Crystalvale launched on March 30, 2022. This was the first expansion to DeFi Kingdoms and lives on [DFK Chain](defi-kingdoms-blockchain.md), an Avalanche subnet. Crystalvale introduced the new Power Token, [CRYSTAL](power-tokens/crystal-token.md), along with new Hero classes, and a brand new world to explore.

## Serendale 2.0 (Klaytn)

DeFi Kingdoms: Serendale relaunched on the Klaytn blockchain on December 7, 2022, using the new Power Token, JADE, and bringing additional Hero classes and an updated flavor to match its new home.
