### JEWEL Hard Cap

The JEWEL token has a hard cap of **125,000,000** tokens.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The JEWEL cap was lowered from 500m as part of the project's [updated tokenomics](https://medium.com/defi-kingdoms-official/serendale-2-0-e9db21d46178). The remaining 375m JEWEL tokens are being re-distributed as Locked, Vested, and Unlocked JEWEL, CRYSTAL, and JADE on DFK Chain and Klaytn.
{% endhint %}

As of December 2022, all JEWEL that will ever exist has been minted, though some remains held in vesting contracts.

### Token Allocations

JEWEL has the following token allocations:

{% hint style="info" %}
These allocations are based on the original emissions schedule and 500m maximum token supply. Since JEWEL emissions ended early, approximately 386.5m JEWEL was emitted from the Gardens in addition to the 10m JEWEL pre-mint. All 283.6m locked JEWEL was converted as part of the project's [updated tokenomics](https://medium.com/defi-kingdoms-official/serendale-2-0-e9db21d46178).
{% endhint %}

* **10,000,000 JEWEL** - Pre-Mints as described below
* **\~418,800,000 JEWEL** - Emitted from the Gardens to reward liquidity providers and locked/unlocked according to the [Issuance Schedule](../the-gardens/jewel-gardens.md#issuance-schedule).
* **\~71,200,000 JEWEL** - Emitted from the Gardens to fund the project and reward players. These emissions did not count against those described in [JEWEL Gardens](../the-gardens/), and were subject to separate [locking rates](../the-gardens/#allocations-and-rewards). These allocations were broken down as follows:
  * \~13.82m unlocked JEWEL / \~11.31m locked JEWEL - Development Fund Multisig
  * \~13.82m unlocked JEWEL / \~11.31m locked JEWEL - Marketing Fund Multisig
  * \~0.84m unlocked JEWEL / \~15.91m locked JEWEL - Founders Fund Multisig
  * \~2.3m unlocked JEWEL / \~1.89m locked JEWEL - Jeweler (to reward xJEWEL stakers)

### Pre-Minting

**10,000,000 JEWEL** tokens were pre-minted and distributed as follows:

* **5,000,000 JEWEL**: Allocated to the Development Fund Multisig Safe to fund the future development of the game. These tokens were time-locked and released over a set schedule as features are completed.
* **2,000,000 JEWEL**: Allocated to the Marketing Fund Multisig Safe for promotion of the project, including marketing, airdrops, etc. These tokens were also time-locked to release slowly over the next few years to ensure that there are always funds available to market the game and acquire new players and traders.
* **2,000,000 JEWEL**: Allocated for initial liquidity. These tokens were matched with ONE tokens to form the initial liquidity pool and will not be withdrawn or sold.
  * **Initial Liquidity Fund: **_****_ The LP tokens from the initial liquidity are held in the [Marketing Fund Multsig Safe](https://explorer.harmony.one/address/0x3875e5398766a29c1b28cc2068a0396cba36ef99).
* **1,000,000 JEWEL**: Allocated to the Founders Fund Multisig Safe for bounties and hours for the founding team based on their work towards launch. Half of these tokens were awarded at launch, and the other half will vest over time.

### Multisig Wallet Treasury

{% hint style="info" %}
_Note: Most liquid funds from these multisigs have been moved to their counterparts on DFK Chain. Locked JEWEL held in these wallets was redistributed according to the project's updated tokenomics._
{% endhint %}

**Our funds are secured in multisig wallets at** [**https://multisig.harmony.one**](https://multisig.harmony.one)**.** These wallets will be controlled by 4 members of the core team, which may change from time to time. Any transaction will require 3 out of 4 signatures to execute. This helps to protect against hacks that would target the treasuries, ensuring that there is no single point of failure. Additionally, this protects against any one member of the team having the power to make any changes on their own, without the rest of the team being aware of and agreeing to it. It also gives 100% transparency, as anyone can view all of the transactions that are proposed before they are executed, as well as a history of every past transaction that was executed, including the executing wallets.&#x20;

We know there has been concern with some other projects selling a large amount of tokens at launch that left some feeling frustrated in the project. We seek to help put these concerns at ease with these measures to help our community have confidence in the DeFi Kingdoms project.&#x20;
