### **Pre-Minting**

A small amount of JADE was pre-minted prior to launch and distributed as follows:

* ****[**Klaytn Utility Wallet**](https://scope.klaytn.com/account/0xfECBd8Dd13fB958594Ad5d22d477786622A58Bca)**: 37,500  JADE**— for initial LP Liquidity

### **Initial Liquidity**

In addition to the pre-mint of 37,500 JADE, an additional 300,000 JADE (from the liquid JADE distribution to the Dev Fund) plus the equivalent of JEWEL from project funds was allocated toward initial liquidity for the JADE–JEWEL and JADE-KLAY Liquidity Pairs. **These LP Tokens and others created by the project are held in the** [**Liquidity Fund Multisig**](https://scope.klaytn.com/account/0x65b8131cb67c7f17e60b9114bcc0ae9755ae89a0) **and never placed in the Gardens.**
