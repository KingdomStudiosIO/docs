# Decentralized Exchange

DeFi Kingdoms currently has two decentralized exchanges that use the tried-and-true UniswapV2 Protocol. DeFi Kingdoms: Crystalvale's DEX trades in JEWEL, CRYSTAL, AVAX, and a variety of tokens on DFK Chain, our Avalanche subnet, while DeFi Kingdoms: Serendale's DEX trades in JEWEL, JADE, KLAY, and a host of tokens on Klaytn. Trading is one of the main reasons we are drawn to blockchain technology and we want to make the experience fun and enjoyable for all within the realms.

From the Marketplace, you can swap tokens at the current exchange rates. You can also become a liquidity provider by adding liquidity to any token pools youâ€™d like. These will earn you fees any time anyone trades those tokens. Additionally, the LP tokens for certain incentivized token pairings can also earn CRYSTAL or JADE rewards when staked in the Gardens.
