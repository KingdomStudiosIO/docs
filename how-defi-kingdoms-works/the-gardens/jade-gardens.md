### Locking Mechanism

To balance the high emissions rates in earlier Epochs and to provide price stability, JADE tokenomics include a locking model on Garden rewards. When rewards are claimed, a certain portion goes directly into the player’s wallet, while the remainder is allocated to the player’s wallet but locked.

The percentage of JADE that is unlocked begins at 5% in Epoch 1 and increases by 2% each Epoch. Unclaimed rewards continue to unlock on this schedule until claiming, at which time unlocked rewards go directly into the player’s wallet and locked rewards become **fully locked until the end of Epoch 51.**

Claimed locked JADE will remain locked until approximately **November 30, 2023**, which marks the end of **Epoch 51.** Locked rewards will begin unlocking ratably at that time over the following 52 Epochs.
